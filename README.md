# ReactVR

Welcome to this ReactVR course. This course will help you understand the most basics elements of ReactVR. Please follow the guide and answer the questions. A proposed solutions for every task is found in X/Y folder. 

## Getting Started
This course requires that you have node installed. Please follow the next steps if you have not installed node before. 
- Download the latest stable version from node.org. 
- To verify, write ```node -v``` in the terminal / console application. 
- To verify that npm is also installed, write ```npm -v``` in the terminal / console application.
- After cloning this project, remember to ```npm install``` before you start this course.

## Task 1 - Init you ReactVR project
This task will explain how you init your ReactVR project. Open up the **Basics/index.vr.js** file and take a brief look inside it. This will be the main file we are going to work with. But first, let's take a look into the file **Basics/vr/client.js**. Above line 12 ```...options,``` add ```enableHotReload: true,``` and hit save. This will enable the hot reloader. That is, our application will automatically change it's view whenever we save a change inside our code! 

Now go back to your terminal / console application and write ```npm start```. Ooops! Remember du ```cd``` into the Basic folder, if you have not done so yet! (Psst. ```cd``` stand for change directory and is the same as opening the folder in the finder app or directory on you mac/computer). When the terminal / console is done building your reactVR project go ahead and open http://localhost:8081/vr/. By the way, loading the page can take some time, expesially the first time you are doing it.
